    # Given a sequence of numbers, find the all odd number and between [-5, 5]
    # Using a while loop
    # Using a for loop
    # Using list comprehension
    # Hint1: In part 1 you should initiate i as index of seq and increment it at the end of each loop iteration
    #       extract the element by call seq[INDEX]

    # Hint2: In part 2 you can use the same strategy as 1 but a better way is to directly extract the value
    #       # e.g. for i in seq: ... Note here i is not the index of seq, instead it is the value of seq at that index

    # Hint3: IN part 3 if you implementation is same as described as in part2 you can simply convert it into
    #       List comprehension as we shown in Lecture 2

    # End Notes: Always check back on Lecture covered. Google is your Friend!!
