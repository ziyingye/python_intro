    Calculate the area of square, name your function an compute_square(top_left, bottom_right) 
    where top_left, bottom_right should ba vertices of top left corner and bottom right corner respectively
    e.g top_left = (i,j) bottom_right = (i+k, j+k) where k is the length of the side in the square
    return the area of square and print the result using fstring in 3 decimal place

    # P2:
    Create an dictionary which contain at least 5 info of yourself. Inverse the dictionary and store 
    inverse dictionary's key in a list. Finally add this list to original dictionary with key="comb_info"
    '''

    '''
    # P3:
    Loop through the key's in you dictionary(original dict after adding comb_info) create in P2, stores key in a list
    and sort it in alphabetic order
